* Testing different capability
2020-01-10 versus [2020-12-05 Sat] versus <2020-12-05 Sat>

* Applications
- NYU
- Brown
- MIT Sloan
- UPenn
- Georgia Tech
- Cornell
- Cornell Tech
- JHU
- BU
- University of Washington
- UC Santa Cruz

** My Maybe Schools 
- Washington University in St. Louis (maybe)
- Vanderbuilt (maybe)
- CMU (maybe)
- Marylard College Park (maybe)
- Univ of Utah

Besides UC Santa Cruz, all the applications are on Interfolio or
AcademicJobs which take a generic letter.  If you let me know when
you're ready, I can send out the request.  I think the letter would be
similar to last years, with maybe a paragraph about the thesis and the
hiring freezes last year.
