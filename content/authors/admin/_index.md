I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at
MIT in CSAIL.  My research focuses on the theories and methodologies
towards monitoring, designing, and augmenting machines that can
**explain** themselves for diagnosis, accountability, and
liability. My long-term research vision is for self-explaining,
intelligent, machines by design.  During my PhD, I have developed
local monitoring frameworks to explain opaque mechanims, towards a
full-system that uses explanations for more robust decision making.
This allows machines and other complex mechanisms to be able to
interpret their actions and learn from their mistakes.



**I am on the academic job market this year.** My materials are
available: [research statement](files/research.pdf), [teaching
statement](files/teaching.pdf),
[diversity statement](files/diversity.pdf), [curriculum vitae](files/cv.pdf)
